# 🌐 Build a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** lets you provision a logically isolated network within AWS. It allows complete control over your IP addressing, subnets, route tables, and internet access.

This project covers:

- Creating a custom VPC
- Setting up subnets
- Attaching an internet gateway
- Understanding the difference between public and private subnets

## 🧱 Key Components

### 🔹 Custom VPC Creation
- Defined an IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., `/16`)
- Replaced the default VPC with a tailored configuration for better control

### 🔹 Subnets
- Created public and private subnets across availability zones
- Enabled auto-assignment of public IPs for instances in public subnets

### 🔹 Internet Gateway
- Attached an internet gateway to the VPC
- Enabled instances in the public subnet to access the internet
