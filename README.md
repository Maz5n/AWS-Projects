#  AWS Hands-On Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **AWS Hands-On Projects Repository**! 


Each project demonstrates practical knowledge of key AWS services through real-world use cases â€” from deploying static websites to analyzing data, sending emails, using machine learning, and more.

##  How I Work

For each project:

* I **followed a guided AWS tutorial**
* Performed the steps manually using the **AWS Console**
* Troubleshot errors, managed permissions, and customized configurations
* Documented each project in a dedicated folder (including descriptions, screenshots, and outcomes)

##  Repository Structure


Each folder contains:

* A brief project summary
* Steps taken
* Screenshots or results
* Optional exported files (e.g., PDF reports, JSON files)

##  Why This Matters

These projects reflect my practical cloud skills and ability to:

* Use AWS services in real-world scenarios
* Troubleshoot and resolve deployment or permission issues
* Translate documentation into hands-on results
