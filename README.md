# ☁️ AWS Hands-On Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **AWS Hands-On Projects Repository**! 👋
This repository contains projects I’ve completed using tutorials from the official **[AWS Getting Started Hands-On Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/)** portal.

Each project demonstrates practical knowledge of key AWS services through real-world use cases — from deploying static websites to analyzing data, sending emails, using machine learning, and more.

## 📌 About This Repository

All projects here were built by following and extending hands-on tutorials provided directly by Amazon Web Services. These tutorials helped me gain experience across multiple AWS services while understanding best practices for cloud infrastructure, security, and scalability.

## 🛠️ How I Work

For each project:

* I **followed a guided AWS tutorial**
* Performed the steps manually using the **AWS Console**
* Troubleshot errors, managed permissions, and customized configurations
* Documented each project in a dedicated folder (including descriptions, screenshots, and outcomes)

---

## 📚 Tutorials Used

All projects were built from the official AWS Hands-On Tutorials:
👉 [https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on)

I sorted by the **latest publish date** and selected labs across various domains to gain experience with storage, AI/ML, security, data analysis, and cloud infrastructure.
